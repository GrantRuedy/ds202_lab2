```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

How are ratings distributed?
```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
boxplot(choco$Rating, plot=FALSE)$out
```
The shape appears to be normally distributed, and there doesnt appear to be any  
obvious outliers. Looking at the boxplot, there appears to be 51 outliers.


Do ratings depend on the cacao percentage of a chocolate bar?
```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating)
```

Based on the scatterplot between cacao percentage and ratings, there is no  
relationship between these variables. This concludes that ratings do not depend on cacao percentage.
