```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Lab 2

```{r}
choco <- read.csv("https://xdaiisu.github.io/ds202materials/hwlabs/choco.csv")
head(choco)
```

1.

```{r}
hist(choco$Rating)
```

The histogram looks like it is approximately normal centered around a rating of 3.  

2.
```{r}
plot(choco$Cocoa.Pct, choco$Rating, xlab = 'Cocoa Percentage', ylab = 'Rating')
rating1 = choco[choco$Rating == 1,]
rating2 = choco[choco$Rating == 2,]
rating3 = choco[choco$Rating == 3,]
rating4 = choco[choco$Rating == 4,]
rating5 = choco[choco$Rating == 5,]
boxplot(rating1$Cocoa.Pct, rating2$Cocoa.Pct, rating3$Cocoa.Pct, rating4$Cocoa.Pct, rating5$Cocoa.Pct, xlab = 'Rating', ylab = 'Cocoa Percentage')
```


Ratings do not depend on cocoa percentage in the chocolate bar because the means are all very similar.  There is no linear trend in the scatterplot.
